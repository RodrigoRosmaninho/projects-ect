/******************************************************************************
 * Paulo Pedreiras. Sept 2021
 * 
 * This demo creates a periodic task and a load/interfering task.
 * These tasks have settable priorities and the time used by each instance 
 * of the load/interfering task can also be tuned.
 * On each instance tasks actuate on the leds and write a message to the UART.
 * 
 * History:
 * 2019/04: adapted form DETPIC to Digilent ChipKit boards
 * 2020/04: adapted to the latest release of FreeRTOS (V10.3.1)
 * 2021/09: adapted to FreeRTOS V202107.00, MPLAB X IDE v5.45, XC32 V2.50
